## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision

Joanie's Kitchen helps people waste less food by making it easy to cook with what they already have. Inspired by Joanie Zisk's philosophy of resourcefulness and zero-waste cooking, we're building technology that serves people and the planetâ€”not consumption.

**Core Mission:** Stop food waste. Start cooking with what you have.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Philosophy

Every feature we build asks these questions:
1. Does this help users waste less food?
2. Does this promote cooking with what you have?
3. Would Joanie approve?
4. Does this serve resourcefulness or consumption?

If the answer is no to any question, we don't build it.
