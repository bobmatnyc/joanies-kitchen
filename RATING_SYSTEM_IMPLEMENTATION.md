# Recipe Rating System Implementation

## Overview

Complete frontend implementation of a 5-star rating and review system for recipe pages. The backend was already implemented - this adds the full UI/UX layer.

## Components Created

### 1. RatingDisplay Component
**Location:** `/src/components/recipe/RatingDisplay.tsx`

- Three sizes: small, medium, large
- Clickable to scroll to reviews section
- Accessible with proper ARIA labels
- Handles "no ratings yet" state gracefully

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  averageRating: number | string | null;
  totalRatings: number;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';

}
```

**Design:**
- Gold stars (#FFD700) for filled

  isAuthenticated: boolean;
}
```

**Layout:**
- Rating summary at top (with gradient background)
- User's rating input (if authenticated)
- All reviews list below
- Smooth scroll-to-reviews functionality

## Backend Integration

### Server Actions (Already Implemented)
Located in `/src/app/actions/rate-recipe.ts`:

- `rateRecipe(recipeId, rating, review?)` - Submit/update rating
- `getUserRating(recipeId)` - Get current user's rating
- `getRecipeRatings(recipeId, limit, offset)` - Get paginated reviews **[ENHANCED]**
- `deleteRating(recipeId)` - Delete user's rating

### Database Schema (Already Implemented)
Table: `recipeRatings`
- `id` (uuid)
- `recipe_id` (text, foreign key)
- `user_id` (text, Clerk ID)
- `rating` (integer 0-5)
- `review` (text, optional)
- `created_at` (timestamp)
- `updated_at` (timestamp)

Unique constraint: one rating per user per recipe

Recipe table fields:
- `avg_user_rating` (decimal)
- `total_user_ratings` (integer)

### Enhancement Made to Backend

Updated `getRecipeRatings()` to:
- Join with `userProfiles` table to get display names and avatars
- Support pagination with offset parameter
- Return formatted review objects with user data
- Handle missing profiles gracefully (show "Anonymous User")

## Integration with Recipe Page

### File Modified
`/src/app/recipes/[slug]/page.tsx`

### Changes Made

1. **Imports Added:**
   ```typescript
   import { RatingDisplay } from '@/components/recipe/RatingDisplay';
   import { RecipeRatings } from '@/components/recipe/RecipeRatings';
   ```

2. **Header Metadata Addition:**
   Added rating display to recipe metadata row (line ~661):
   ```tsx
   {(recipe.avg_user_rating || recipe.total_user_ratings > 0) && (
     <RatingDisplay
       averageRating={recipe.avg_user_rating}
       totalRatings={recipe.total_user_ratings || 0}
       size="sm"
       showCount
       onClick={() => {
         const ratingsSection = document.getElementById('ratings-and-reviews');
         ratingsSection?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
       }}
     />
   )}
   ```

3. **Full Rating Section Addition:**
   Added before delete dialog (line ~835):
   ```tsx
   {/* RATINGS & REVIEWS SECTION */}
   <div className="mb-8">
     <RecipeRatings
       recipeId={recipe.id}
       averageRating={recipe.avg_user_rating}
       totalRatings={recipe.total_user_ratings || 0}
       currentUserId={user?.id}
       isAuthenticated={isSignedIn || false}
     />
   </div>
   ```

5. Can update rating and review
6. Can delete their rating
7. Sees all other reviews below
8. Can load more reviews via pagination

### Non-Authenticated User

6. Cannot submit ratings without signing in

## Performance Optimizations

- Memoized components where appropriate
- Smooth transitions and animations
