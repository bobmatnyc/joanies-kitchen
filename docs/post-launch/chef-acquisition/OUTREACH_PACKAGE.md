## Email Template: Anne-Marie Bonneau (Zero Waste Chef)

**Subject**: Partnership Opportunity: Zero-Waste Recipe Platform

```
Dear Anne-Marie,

My name is [Your Name], and I'm the creator of Joanie's Kitchen (joanies-kitchen.com),
a recipe platform dedicated to zero-waste cooking and sustainable food practices.

I've been following your incredible work at Zero Waste Chef for years, and your
mission deeply aligns with ours. We recently pivoted our platform to focus exclusively
on zero-waste, seasonal, and sustainable cookingâ€”inspired by pioneers like you.

I'm writing to explore a partnership opportunity to feature your recipes on our
platform. Here's what we're proposing:

**What We Offer:**
- Full attribution with prominent links back to zerowastechef.com
- Traffic analytics sharing (see which recipes drive engagement)
- Recipe discovery through our "Fridge Feature" (helps users find recipes based on
  ingredients they already haveâ€”reducing food waste)
- SEO benefits (we're indexed by Google with 5,000+ recipe pages)
- No ads, no paywallsâ€”just helping people cook sustainably

**What We're Asking:**
- Permission to feature your public recipes from zerowastechef.com
- Recipe data extraction (we'll handle all technical work)
- Proper attribution with chef bio, photo, and links to your site

**Why This Matters:**
Every recipe we index helps reduce food waste. Our platform's core feature helps users
cook with what they have, preventing ingredients from going to waste. Your recipes
are perfect for this mission.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss this partnership? I'd love to show you
the platform and get your input on how we can best represent your work.

Thank you for all you do to promote zero-waste living.

Best regards,
