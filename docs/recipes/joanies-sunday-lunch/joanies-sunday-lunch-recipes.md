## Recipe 1: Resourceful Chickpea & Vegetable Soup

**Serves:** 4-6  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Source:** Joanie's kitchen improvisation

### The Story
Made from leftover crudité vegetables that were about to expire, this soup embodies Joanie's philosophy: "What do I have that might go bad?" The result is somewhere between vegetable soup and pasta sauce - thick, satisfying, and completely flexible.

### Ingredients

**Base Vegetables (use what you have):**
- 2 cups zucchini, roughly chopped (about 1 medium)
- 2 cups yellow summer squash, roughly chopped
- 1 medium onion, roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed
- Additional vegetables as available (bell peppers, carrots, etc.)

**Liquid & Flavor:**
- 4 cups water (or vegetable stock)
- 3 tablespoons tomato paste (half a 6oz can)
- 1 can (15oz) chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Optional Enrichment:**
- 2-3 tablespoons grated Grana Padano or Parmesan (adds richness but makes it taste more like pasta sauce)
- Fresh herbs for serving (parsley, basil)

### Instructions

1. **Sauté the vegetables:** Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, cook 2-3 minutes until fragrant. Add zucchini, summer squash, and any other vegetables. Season with salt and pepper. Cook 8-10 minutes until softened.

2. **Create the base:** Add 4 cups water to the pot. Bring to a simmer and cook 5 minutes until vegetables are very tender.

3. **Blend:** Using an immersion blender ("zizz it"), blend the mixture until smooth. You're creating a thick vegetable broth base.

4. **Add tomato paste:** Stir in tomato paste until fully incorporated. Taste - it should have some acidity and depth.

5. **Add chickpeas:** Stir in chickpeas but DO NOT BLEND. You want them whole for texture, not hummus-like.

6. **Adjust consistency:** If too thick or too tomato-forward, add more water 1/4 cup at a time. If it tastes too much like pasta sauce, you've gone the Grana Padano route or used too much tomato paste.

7. **Serve:** Ladle into bowls. Top with fresh herbs.

### Joanie's Notes

> "I could have watered it down more if I didn't want it to taste so much like pasta sauce. I wouldn't serve this to guests necessarily... but I would serve it on pasta. It would be a perfectly good pasta sauce. But now it had chickpeas in it. So it is what it is."

**What this teaches:**
- Improvisation sometimes creates something between intentions
- Adding cheese pushed it toward pasta sauce territory (still good, just different than planned)
- The dish worked for weeknight dinner even if not guest-worthy
- Could be repurposed as pasta sauce in the future

### Substitutions
- **Summer squash:** Any soft vegetable that sautés well (eggplant, bell peppers, mushrooms)
- **Chickpeas:** White beans, lentils, or any canned bean
- **Tomato paste:** Fresh tomatoes (2 cups chopped) or skip for lighter soup
- **Grana Padano:** Skip entirely for cleaner vegetable flavor, or use Parmesan

### Storage
Refrigerate 4-5 days. Freezes well for 3 months (thickens when reheated, add water to adjust).

## Recipe 2: Asian-Inspired Chicken & Cauliflower Rice Bowl

**Serves:** 4  
**Time:** 35 minutes (25 active, 10 passive)  
**Source:** Joanie's Sunday spread

### The Story
Three distinct Asian-inspired components (Chinese black bean chicken, Indian curried cauliflower, Japanese miso tofu) served over rice. Mixed ethnic profiles, unified by bold flavors and simple techniques.

### For the Black Bean Garlic Chicken

**Ingredients:**
- 1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 3-4 tablespoons jarred black bean garlic sauce (Lee Kum Kee or similar)
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 425°F.
2. Toss chicken thighs with black bean garlic sauce until coated.
3. Arrange in a single layer in a baking dish or on a sheet pan.
4. Roast 20 minutes until cooked through (internal temp 165°F).

### For the Curried Roasted Cauliflower

**Ingredients:**
- 1 large head cauliflower, broken into florets
- 2 tablespoons neutral oil
- 2 teaspoons yellow curry powder (turmeric-heavy)
- Salt to taste

**Instructions:**
1. Toss cauliflower florets with oil, curry powder, and salt.
2. Spread on a baking sheet in a single layer.
3. Roast at 425°F for 25-30 minutes, stirring halfway, until golden and tender with some crispy edges.

### For the Miso Tofu

**Ingredients:**
- 14-16 oz firm tofu, pressed
- 3 tablespoons white miso paste
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon neutral oil

**To press tofu:**
- Wrap block in a clean dish towel
- Place between two plates
- Weight with canned goods on top
- Let sit 15-30 minutes; moisture will be absorbed by towel

**Instructions:**
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (if doing all components together).
2. Cut pressed tofu into 1-inch cubes (or tear with hands for irregular pieces with more surface area - Joanie's preference for better crisping).
3. Whisk together miso, brown sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar until smooth.
4. Toss tofu cubes with oil, then with miso mixture.
5. Arrange on a baking sheet.
6. Bake 20-25 minutes, flipping once, until golden.

### For the Rice

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups jasmine or short-grain white rice (Tiger brand or similar)
- Water according to rice cooker instructions (typically 2.5-3 cups for 2 cups rice)

**Instructions:**
- Rinse rice until water runs clear
- Add to rice cooker with appropriate water
- Cook according to rice cooker settings

### To Serve

1. Divide rice among four bowls
2. Top each with:
   - Sliced black bean chicken
   - Roasted curry cauliflower
   - Miso tofu cubes
3. Drizzle any pan juices from chicken or tofu over the bowl
4. Optional garnishes: sliced scallions, sesame seeds, pickled vegetables

### Joanie's Notes

> "So you're mixing ethnic profiles."  
> "Oh, yeah. That was Indian, Chinese and Japanese."

**What this teaches:**
- Fusion isn't fusion if each component respects its tradition
- All three dishes use 425°F, so they can roast simultaneously
- The rice cooker handles one component passively while you prep others
- Simple sauces (jarred black bean sauce, miso glaze) deliver restaurant-quality results

### Substitutions

**Chicken:**
- Use bone-in thighs (increase roasting time to 35-40 min)
- Use pork chops or pork tenderloin
- Skip protein, double the tofu

**Cauliflower:**
- Use broccoli, Brussels sprouts, or diced sweet potato
- Change spice profile: smoked paprika, za'atar, or cumin

**Tofu:**
- Use salmon or white fish (reduce cooking time to 12-15 min)
- The miso glaze works on anything

**Rice:**
- Use brown rice (adjust cooking time)
- Use quinoa or farro
- Use cauliflower rice for low-carb

## Recipe 3: Garden Green Salad with Dill Mustard Dressing

**Serves:** 4-6  
**Time:** 15 minutes  
**Source:** Joanie's garden and crisper drawer

### The Story
This salad is "tail ends" - the beet tops from a single garden beet, the last of the savoy cabbage, the arugula that needs using. The dill mustard dressing brings it all together. The pickled cucumber on the side was from the garden harvest.

### For the Salad

**Base Greens (use what needs using):**
- 2 cups savoy cabbage, thinly sliced
- 2 cups beet greens (or Swiss chard, kale), roughly torn
- 2 cups arugula
- 1 large cucumber, sliced (or quick-pickled - see notes)

**Additional vegetables as available:**
- Radishes, thinly sliced
- Carrots, shaved
- Cherry tomatoes, halved
- Red onion, thinly sliced

### For the Dill Mustard Dressing

**Ingredients:**
- 1/2 cup olive oil
- 1/4 cup vinegar (white wine, apple cider, or rice wine)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (the emulsifier)
- 2 tablespoons fresh dill, chopped (or 2 teaspoons dried)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1-2 tablespoons water (to mellow if too acidic)

**Instructions:**
1. Combine all ingredients in a jar or bullet blender.
2. Shake vigorously or blend until emulsified (about 30 seconds).
3. Taste and adjust:
   - Too sour? Add water or more oil
   - Too oily? Add lemon juice or water
   - Needs more zing? Add more mustard or salt
4. Store in refrigerator for up to 1 week. Shake before using.

### For Quick-Pickled Cucumbers (Optional)

**Ingredients:**
- 1 large cucumber, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar or white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Fresh dill sprigs

**Instructions:**
1. Combine vinegar, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Stir until dissolved.
2. Add cucumber slices and dill. Toss to coat.
3. Let sit 15-30 minutes before serving. (Can be made up to 3 days ahead.)

### To Assemble

1. Combine all salad greens in a large bowl
2. Add any additional vegetables
3. Drizzle with dressing (start with 1/4 cup, add more as needed)
4. Toss to coat evenly
5. Serve immediately with pickled cucumbers on the side

### Joanie's Notes

> "Two to one, oil to vinegar. But you can do two to one oil to vinegar. And depending on the vinegar that you're using, it could be perfect or it could be too sour. Sometimes if it's too sour, you could try to add more oil but then it's too oily. So then I recommend you can start off 2 to 1, oil to vinegar, and adjust with lemon juice or even water, believe it or not, because water will mellow out, thin out the vinegar so you don't have to add more oil to balance it. The mustard is the thing that will make it emulsify when you're not paying attention."

**What this teaches:**
- The 2:1 ratio is a starting point, not a rule
- Water is a tool for balance (not just oil)
- Mustard does the work of emulsification
- Taste and adjust is the real skill

### Substitutions

**Greens:**
- Use ANY greens that need using: spinach, lettuce, kale, chard, mustard greens
- Wilting greens? They're fine for salad if they're just "a little slimy" - Joanie would sauté them

**Dressing:**
- Skip dill, use any herb: parsley, basil, cilantro, tarragon
- Skip mustard for a lighter vinaigrette (won't emulsify as well)
- Use lime juice instead of lemon
- Use different vinegars for different profiles

### Joanie's Philosophy in Action

This meal demonstrates:

1. **Using what needs using:** Leftover crudité, beet tops, aging vegetables
2. **FIFO in practice:** Tomato paste, vegetables near expiration
3. **Flexible ethnic inspiration:** Chinese, Japanese, Indian - "mixing ethnic profiles"
4. **One-temperature cooking:** Everything roasts at 425°F simultaneously
5. **Passive cooking:** Rice cooker handles rice while you handle everything else
6. **Resourcefulness over perfection:** "It is what it is" - soup that's between soup and sauce
7. **Honest self-assessment:** "I wouldn't serve this to guests necessarily" but it fed the family well

### Yield & Scaling

- **As written:** Serves 4-6 people
- **Soup alone:** 4-6 bowls
- **Rice bowl:** 4 generous servings
- **Salad:** 4-6 side salads

### Storage & Leftovers

**Soup:**
- Refrigerate 4-5 days
- Freeze 3 months
- Can be served over pasta (becomes sauce)

**Rice Bowl Components:**
- Chicken: 3-4 days refrigerated
- Cauliflower: 3-4 days refrigerated, loses crispness
- Tofu: 3-4 days refrigerated
- Rice: 3-4 days refrigerated

**Salad:**
- Dress only what you'll eat immediately
- Undressed greens: 2-3 days in fridge
- Dressing: 1 week in fridge

### Total Cost Estimate

- **Budget-friendly:** Most ingredients are vegetables, beans, chicken thighs
- **Expensive items:** Only jarred black bean sauce, miso paste (both last months)
- **Cost per serving:** Approximately $3-4 per person

### Environmental & Waste Notes

- Zero food waste: Uses vegetables about to expire, beet tops, aging produce
- Garden integration: Beets, cucumbers, herbs from garden
- Pantry utilization: Half-used tomato paste, jarred sauces with long shelf life
- Compostable scraps: Cauliflower stems, onion skins, garlic papers

## Final Notes from Joanie

> "You can't repeat."

This meal can't be exactly recreated because it was made from what was available that day. That's the whole point. These recipes provide the framework - you provide the vegetables that need using, the proteins in your fridge, the herbs from your garden.

**The real recipe is the approach:**
1. Look in your fridge
2. What needs using?
3. What technique makes sense?
4. What flavors would work?
5. Make it happen

These three recipes are less instructions and more documentation of that philosophy in action.
