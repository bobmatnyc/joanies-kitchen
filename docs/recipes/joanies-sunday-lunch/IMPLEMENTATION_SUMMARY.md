## Joanie's Philosophy Captured

The implementation preserves Joanie's zero-waste cooking philosophy:

1. **"You can't repeat"**
   - Recipes document approach, not exact measurements
   - Flexible ingredient lists
   - Substitution-friendly design

2. **"What needs using?"**
   - Resourcefulness scores (4-5/5)
   - Waste reduction tags
   - Scrap utilization notes

3. **"Using what needs using"**
   - Leftover vegetables
   - Beet tops (usually discarded)
   - Aging produce rescue

4. **"It is what it is"**
   - Honest assessment captured in descriptions
   - Acceptance of imperfection
   - Practical over perfect

5. **Efficient Cooking**
   - One-temperature cooking (425Â°F for all components)
   - Passive cooking (rice cooker)
   - Multi-tasking approach

## Technical Implementation

### Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/create-joanies-sunday-lunch.ts`**
   - Main creation script
   - Creates chef, recipes, meal plan, links
   - Initially attempted embedding generation (failed due to API signature mismatch)

2. **`scripts/generate-joanie-embeddings.ts`**
   - Dedicated embedding generation script
   - Successfully generated all 3 embeddings
   - Proper API signature usage

3. **`scripts/verify-joanie-lunch.ts`**
   - Verification script
   - Confirms all database records created correctly
   - Validates embeddings

### Key Learnings

1. **Embedding API Signature**
   - `generateRecipeEmbedding(recipe)` returns `{ embedding, embeddingText, modelName }`
   - Must destructure the result before passing to `saveRecipeEmbedding()`

2. **Database Relationships**
   - Recipes link to chefs via both `chef_id` field AND `chef_recipes` junction table
   - Meals link to recipes via `meal_recipes` junction table with course metadata

3. **Slug Generation**
   - `generateUniqueSlug()` utility automatically ensures uniqueness
   - SEO-friendly URLs created automatically
