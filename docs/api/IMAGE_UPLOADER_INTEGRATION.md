# ImageUploader Vercel Blob Integration

## Overview

Successfully integrated the Vercel Blob upload API with the ImageUploader component. Images are now uploaded to CDN storage instead of being stored as data URLs in memory.

## Changes Summary

### Component: `/src/components/recipe/ImageUploader.tsx`

#### New Features

1. **Real CDN Upload Integration**
   - Images are uploaded to Vercel Blob via `/api/upload` endpoint
   - CDN URLs are stored instead of data URLs
   - Automatic cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks

2. **Upload Progress Indicators**
   - Loading spinner overlay on images during upload
   - Upload state indicator in header ("uploading...")
   - Disabled UI elements during active uploads

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Client-side file validation (size, type)
   - User-friendly toast notifications for errors
   - Failed uploads are automatically removed from the list
   - Specific error messages for different failure scenarios

4. **Improved User Experience**
   - Sequential upload processing to avoid overwhelming API
   - Preview images shown immediately with object URLs
   - Preview URLs replaced with CDN URLs upon successful upload
   - Disabled drag-and-drop and file selection during uploads

#### Technical Implementation

**New Dependencies:**
- `Loader2` icon from lucide-react
- `toast` utility from `@/lib/toast`

**New State:**
- `uploadingImages`: Map tracking upload progress for each image
- Tracks upload state, preview URLs, and error messages

**New Functions:**
- `uploadImage()`: Uploads single file to API endpoint
- `processFiles()`: Handles batch file processing and upload
- `isUploadingUrl()`: Checks if specific URL is currently uploading

**Upload Flow:**
```
1. User selects/drops files
2. Client validates files (size, type)
3. Object URL created for immediate preview
4. Files uploaded sequentially to /api/upload
5. Preview URL replaced with CDN URL on success
6. Object URL cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
7. Upload state cleared after completion
```

#### Props (Unchanged)

The component maintains backward compatibility:
```typescript
interface ImageUploaderProps {
  images: string[];            // Now expects CDN URLs
  onChange: (images: string[]) => void;
  maxImages?: number;
}
```

## API Integration

### Endpoint: `POST /api/upload`

**Request:**
```typescript
FormData {
  file: File
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
// Success
{
  success: true,
  url: string  // CDN URL
}

// Error
{
  success: false,
  error: string
}
```

### Validation

**Client-side:**
- Max file size: 5MB
- Allowed types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp
- File count limited by `maxImages` prop

**Server-side:**
- Authentication required (Clerk session)
- File size validation (5MB limit)
- File type validation
- Unique filename generation

## User Experience Improvements

### Visual Feedback

1. **During Upload:**
   - Spinner overlay on uploading image
   - "uploading..." text in header
   - Disabled drag-drop zone with spinner
   - Disabled URL input and buttons

2. **Success:**
   - Toast notification: "Uploaded {filename}"
   - Spinner removed from image
   - UI re-enabled for next upload

3. **Error:**
   - Toast notification with specific error message
   - Failed image removed from grid
   - UI re-enabled for retry

### Error Messages

- "File too large. Maximum size is 5MB."
- "Unsupported format. Use JPEG, PNG, or WebP."
- "Please sign in to upload images." (401)
- "Upload failed. Please try again." (generic)

## Code Quality

### Linting & Type Safety

- ✅ Biome linting compliant
- ✅ TypeScript type-safe
- ✅ Proper React hooks dependencies
- ✅ Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, keyboard support)
- ✅ Memory leak prevention (URL cleanup)

### Performance

- Sequential uploads prevent API overload
- Object URL cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Proper useCallback memoization
- Efficient state updates

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload single JPEG image (< 5MB)
- [ ] Upload multiple images at once
- [ ] Upload PNG and WebP images
- [ ] Try uploading file > 5MB (should show error)
- [ ] Try uploading non-image file (should show error)
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Test file browser selection
- [ ] Verify loading states during upload
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Test image reordering after upload
- [ ] Test image removal after upload
- [ ] Verify uploaded images display correctly

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Use ImageUploader in RecipeUploadWizard
- [ ] Submit recipe with uploaded images
- [ ] Verify CDN URLs are saved to database
- [ ] Verify images display on recipe page
- [ ] Test concurrent uploads in multiple tabs

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - component maintains backward compatibility with existing props.

### Data Migration
No migration needed. Component now accepts both:
- External CDN URLs (from Vercel Blob)
- Direct image URLs (pasted by user)

### Environment Requirements
```bash
# .env.local
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_xxxxx
```

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ImageUploader integrated with upload API
2. ⏳ Update RecipeUploadWizard to use ImageUploader
3. ⏳ Add E2E tests for upload flow
4. ⏳ Monitor upload success rates in production
5. ⏳ Consider adding image optimization (resize, compress)

## Metrics to Track

After deployment, monitor:
- Upload success rate
- Upload failure reasons
- Average upload time
- CDN bandwidth usage
- User adoption rate
