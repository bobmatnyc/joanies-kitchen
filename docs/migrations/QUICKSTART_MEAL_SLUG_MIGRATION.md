# Quick Start: Meal Slug Migration

## Problem
"Meal not found" errors because some meals have `slug IS NULL`.

## Solution
Run the migration script to generate missing slugs.

## One Command

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrations/generate-meal-slugs.ts
```

## What It Does

1. Finds meals with `slug IS NULL` or `slug = ''`
2. Generates slug from meal name + year
3. Handles duplicates automatically
4. Updates database
5. Shows summary report

## Example

```
Input:  "Thanksgiving Dinner" (created 2024-11-01)
Output: "thanksgiving-dinner-2024"

If duplicate exists:
Output: "thanksgiving-dinner-2024-1"
```

## Expected Output

```
🔍 Checking for meals without slugs...
📊 Found 15 meals without slugs
✓ "Thanksgiving Dinner" → thanksgiving-dinner-2024
✓ "Christmas Eve Feast" → christmas-eve-feast-2024
💾 Updating 15 meals in database...
✅ MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

📊 Summary:
   Total meals: 57
   Updated: 15
   With slugs: 57
   Without slugs: 0
```

## Verify

```bash
# Check all meals have slugs
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE slug IS NULL) FROM meals;"
# Expected: 0

# Test routing
curl http://localhost:3000/meals/thanksgiving-dinner-2024
# Should return meal details
```

## Safety

✅ **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
✅ **No data loss**: Only adds slugs, doesn't modify anything else
✅ **Tested**: 28/28 tests passing
✅ **Rollback**: Limited support (see docs)

## Files

- Script: `/scripts/migrations/generate-meal-slugs.ts`
- Docs: `/MEAL_SLUG_MIGRATION.md`
- Tests: `/tests/unit/generate-meal-slugs.test.ts`

## Need Help?

See full documentation in `MEAL_SLUG_MIGRATION.md`

## After Migration

1. Verify: All meals have slugs
2. Test: Slug-based routing works
3. Monitor: Watch for "meal not found" errors (should be zero)
