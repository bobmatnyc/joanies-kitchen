## üéØ Mission-Critical Findings

### Database Status (4,707 Recipes)

| Metric | Count | Status | Action Required |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Total recipes** | 4,707 | ‚úÖ | - |
| **Missing ingredients** | 20 (0.42%) | üî¥ CRITICAL | Fix before launch |
| **Missing instructions** | 211 (4.48%) | üî¥ CRITICAL | Fix or hide |
| **Normalized ingredients** | 4,620 (98.15%) | ‚úÖ GOOD | - |
| **Validation status** | 0% validated | ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN | Run QA system |

### Key Discovery

**The platform has never systematically validated that ingredient lists match recipe instructions.** This is critical for the fridge feature's zero-waste mission.

**Example Issue Found**: 45% of sampled recipes mention "salt", "pepper", or "water" in instructions but NOT in ingredient lists.

## üìä Database Architecture Analysis

### How Recipes Store Data

**Dual Storage System**:

1. **Legacy JSON Format** (`recipes.ingredients` and `recipes.instructions`):
   ```json
   {
     "ingredients": "[\"2 cups flour\", \"1 tsp salt\", ...]",
     "instructions": "[\"Mix flour and salt\", \"Add water\", ...]"
   }
   ```
   - Storage: TEXT fields with JSON arrays
   - Coverage: 4,687 recipes (99.6%) have ingredients
   - Format: Simple string arrays

2. **Normalized Relational Format** (`recipeIngredients` join table):
   ```typescript
   {
     recipe_id: "abc123",
     ingredient_id: "uuid-456",
     amount: "2",
     unit: "cups",
     preparation: "sifted",
     position: 1
   }
   ```
   - Storage: Proper relational table with 2,716 master ingredients
   - Coverage: 4,620 recipes (98.15%)
   - Benefits: Enables advanced search, substitutions, nutrition tracking

### Data Quality Issues Discovered

**Critical (Launch Blockers)**:
- 20 recipes with NO ingredient lists
- 211 recipes with NO instructions
- Some recipes have non-string ingredient entries (causes parsing errors)

**High Priority (Impacts Core Feature)**:
- Estimated 200-500 recipes with incomplete ingredient lists
- Common pantry items (salt, pepper, water) often omitted
- 67 recipes have JSON but no normalized ingredients

**Medium Priority (Post-Launch)**:
- 745 recipes have single-step instructions (should be split)
- Format inconsistencies across sources

## üîç Sample Recipe Analysis

### Well-Formed Recipe Example

**"Salmon With Potato Salad and Horseradish Yogurt"**
- ‚úÖ 21 ingredients properly listed
- ‚úÖ 7 detailed instruction steps
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: "water" mentioned in instructions but not in list

### Problematic Recipe Pattern

**Common Issue**: Implied ingredients not listed
```
Instructions: "Season with salt and pepper to taste"
Ingredient List: [flour, eggs, milk]  ‚Üê Missing salt & pepper
```

**Impact**: Fridge feature won't suggest this recipe to users who have salt and pepper but are missing the listed ingredients.

## üéØ Recommended QA Strategy

### 4-Phase Automated Approach

**Phase 1: Structure Validation** (2 hours)
- Scan all 4,707 recipes
- Fix JSON parsing errors
- Identify critical missing data
- **Output**: Critical issue report

**Phase 2: LLM-Based Validation** (10-12 hours)
- Use local LLM (Qwen2.5-7B) to extract ingredients from instructions
- Compare with declared ingredient lists
- Identify missing ingredients with confidence scores
- **Output**: Comprehensive validation report

**Phase 3: Automated Fixes** (2-4 hours)
- Apply high-confidence fixes (‚â•90% confidence)
- Add missing common ingredients
- Fix structural issues
- **Output**: 300-500 recipes auto-corrected

**Phase 4: Manual Review Queue** (4-8 hours)
- Generate CSV for human review
- Prioritize critical issues
- Review uncertain cases
- **Output**: Launch-ready database

---

## ü§ñ LLM Recommendation

### Primary: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct

**Why This Model**:
- ‚úÖ Best structured output capability
- ‚úÖ Fast on Apple Silicon (MPS)
- ‚úÖ Free and runs locally
- ‚úÖ Strong data extraction accuracy

**Performance**:
- Speed: 5-8 seconds per recipe
- Total time: 10-12 hours for all 4,707 recipes
- Cost: $0 (fully local)

**Setup**:
```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
```

### Fallback: GPT-4o-mini via OpenRouter

**When to Use**:
- Time-constrained (6 days to launch)
- Qwen2.5 accuracy insufficient
- Need fastest possible processing

**Performance**:
- Speed: 2-3 seconds per recipe
- Total time: 3-4 hours for all recipes
- Cost: ~$15-25 total

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

### Automated Fix Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **False positives** | üü° MEDIUM | Human review for confidence < 90% |
| **Data corruption** | üî¥ HIGH | Full database backup before fixes |
| **LLM hallucination** | üü° MEDIUM | Conservative confidence thresholds |
| **Over-correction** | üü° MEDIUM | Dry-run mode + manual approval |

### Mitigation Strategy

1. **Database Backup**: Full backup before applying any fixes
2. **Dry-Run Mode**: Test all scripts on sample data first
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: Only auto-fix if ‚â•90% confident
4. **Audit Trail**: Log every change with rollback capability
5. **Incremental Deployment**: Fix critical ‚Üí high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low

**Rollback Capability**: 100% (full backup + change logs)
