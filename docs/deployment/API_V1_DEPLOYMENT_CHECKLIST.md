### 3. Security Configuration ⚠️ CRITICAL

#### HTTPS Enforcement
- [ ] Verify Vercel enforces HTTPS redirects
- [ ] Test API endpoints are HTTPS-only
- [ ] Confirm no mixed content warnings

#### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Configure rate limits per tier:
  - Free: 1,000 requests/hour
  - Pro: 10,000 requests/hour
  - Enterprise: Custom limits
- [ ] Test rate limit enforcement
- [ ] Add rate limit headers to responses
- [ ] Document rate limit behavior

#### Security Headers
- [ ] Add security headers to API responses:
  ```typescript
  'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
  'X-Frame-Options': 'DENY',
  'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block',
  'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
  ```
- [ ] Test CSP headers don't break API clients

---

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY

#### Infrastructure Monitoring
- [ ] Set up Vercel Analytics for API endpoints
- [ ] Configure Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Set up Datadog/NewRelic (if applicable)

#### Security Monitoring
- [ ] Alert on multiple failed auth attempts (>10 in 5 min)
- [ ] Alert on new IP usage for sensitive keys
- [ ] Alert on rapid key creation (>5 in 1 hour)
- [ ] Alert on admin scope key creation

#### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Track API response times (p50, p95, p99)
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- [ ] Create dashboard for API health metrics

---

### 5. Documentation

---

### 2. Production Deployment Strategy

**Deployment Method**: Blue-Green Deployment via Vercel

#### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Week 1)
- [ ] Deploy to production (Vercel automatic deployment)
- [ ] Keep API v1 endpoints accessible but unlisted
- [ ] Invite 5-10 beta partners to test
- [ ] Monitor closely for 48 hours:
  - [ ] Error rates < 0.5%
  - [ ] p95 response time < 500ms
  - [ ] No security incidents
- [ ] Fix any critical issues discovered

#### Phase 2: Limited Launch (Week 2)
- [ ] Announce API v1 to email list
- [ ] Publish API documentation publicly
- [ ] Open API key generation to all users
- [ ] Monitor for 1 week:
  - [ ] Error rates < 1%
  - [ ] p95 response time < 1000ms
  - [ ] Rate limits working correctly
- [ ] Address feedback and bugs

#### Phase 3: General Availability (Week 3+)
- [ ] Announce on all channels
- [ ] Launch developer program
- [ ] Publish SDK libraries (if ready)
- [ ] Start onboarding external developers

### 3. Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on the correct branch
git checkout feature/api-v1-foundation

# 2. Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/api-v1-foundation --no-ff

# 3. Run final tests locally
pnpm test:integration

# 4. Push to GitHub (triggers Vercel deployment)
git push origin main

# 5. Verify deployment on Vercel dashboard
# Production: https://joanies.kitchen
# API Base URL: https://joanies.kitchen/api/v1

# 6. Smoke test production endpoints
curl https://joanies.kitchen/api/v1/recipes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

---

### 4. Deployment Verification

#### Automated Checks
- [ ] Vercel deployment succeeds
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns 200
- [ ] Integration tests pass against production
- [ ] Database migrations applied successfully

#### Manual Smoke Tests
```bash
# 1. Create API key
curl -X POST https://joanies.kitchen/api/v1/auth/keys \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ADMIN_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Key","scopes":["read:recipes"]}'

# 2. List recipes

# Review logs, metrics, and error reports

# 6. Fix issue in feature branch
# Deploy fix to staging first, then production
```
