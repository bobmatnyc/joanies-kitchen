# Database Investigation Report
**Date:** October 27, 2025
**Investigator:** Claude (Research Agent)

## Executive Summary

**Issue Reported:** User reported all meals were gone from the database.

**Actual Root Cause:** Schema drift between Drizzle ORM definition and PostgreSQL database + stale chef recipe_count cache.

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Meals were never lost. Schema fixed and counts synchronized.

---

## Findings

### 1. Meals Status ‚úÖ

- **Total meals in database:** 10
- **Status:** All meals present and intact
- **User complaint was FALSE ALARM** - meals were never deleted

#### Sample Meals Found:
- Chili Party (user_344DZgMGjLal97M6kBrMvBVS3XD)
- Healthy Week Meal Plan (user_synthetic_home_cook)
- Quick Weeknight Dinners (user_synthetic_home_cook)
- Healthy Week Meal Plan (user_synthetic_foodie)
- Quick Weeknight Dinners (user_synthetic_foodie)

### 2. Schema Drift Issue üîß

**Problem:** The `meals` table was missing the `image_url` column that Drizzle ORM expected.

**Symptoms:**
```
DrizzleQueryError: column "image_url" does not exist
```

**Root Cause:**
- Schema definition in `/src/lib/db/meals-schema.ts` included `image_url: text('image_url')` (line 68)
- Database table did not have this column
- Likely a migration was not applied or was rolled back

**Fix Applied:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE "meals" ADD COLUMN "image_url" text
```

### 3. Chef Recipe Count Synchronization üîÑ

**Problem:** Chef `recipe_count` field was out of sync with actual recipes in database.

**Mismatches Found:**

| Chef | Stored Count | Actual Count | Status |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Ina Garten | 0 | 9 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Kenji L√≥pez-Alt | 12 | 1 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recipes deleted |
| Alton Brown | 0 | 10 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Nancy Silverton | 25 | 0 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Recipes deleted |
| Ren√© Redzepi | 0 | 4 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Jeremy Fox | 0 | 2 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Bren Smith | 0 | 3 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Nik Sharma | 0 | 4 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Bryant Terry | 1 | 3 | ‚úÖ Fixed |
| Skye Gyngell | 3 | 15 | ‚úÖ Fixed |

**Fix Applied:** Created and ran `/Users/masa/Projects/joanies-kitchen/scripts/sync-chef-recipe-counts.ts`

### 4. Recipe Deletion Investigation ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Concerning Finding:** Some recipes appear to have been deleted from the database:

- **Kenji L√≥pez-Alt:** Lost 11 recipes (12 ‚Üí 1)
- **Nancy Silverton:** Lost 25 recipes (25 ‚Üí 0)

**Timeline:**
- Oct 26, 2025: Commit `9efa4ee` claimed "All 10 target chefs now have recipes"
- Oct 26, 2025: Commit `53e9c39` "Clean up repository - remove temporary scripts and artifacts"
- Oct 27, 2025: Current investigation shows recipes missing

**Possible Causes:**
1. Accidental deletion during cleanup
2. Database rollback or restore
3. Migration gone wrong
4. Recipes moved to different chef_id

### 5. Chefs Still Needing Recipes

The following 6 chefs have 0 recipes:

1. **Nancy Silverton** (8ba664ab-fa96-4d8b-8d97-682b85dbdfb6) - Previously had 25
2. **Tamar Adler** (72b9ed49-855d-494f-9573-43a6e900aa22)
3. **Dan Barber** (7ba1f4c2-cfef-45bf-a9e3-ee3f99df80ae)

## Database Statistics

- **Total Recipes:** 4,751
- **Total Chefs:** 31
- **Chefs with Recipes:** 25
- **Chefs without Recipes:** 6
- **Recent Recipe Imports (since Oct 26):** 44

---

## Actions Taken

1. ‚úÖ Added missing `image_url` column to meals table
2. ‚úÖ Synchronized all chef `recipe_count` fields with actual database counts
3. ‚úÖ Verified meals data integrity (10 meals present)
4. ‚úÖ Generated comprehensive investigation report

## Scripts Created During Investigation

1. `/Users/masa/Projects/joanies-kitchen/scripts/fix-meals-schema.ts` - Adds missing image_url column
2. `/Users/masa/Projects/joanies-kitchen/scripts/sync-chef-recipe-counts.ts` - Syncs recipe counts
3. `/Users/masa/Projects/joanies-kitchen/scripts/verify-chef-recipes-fixed.ts` - Verification script
4. `/Users/masa/Projects/joanies-kitchen/scripts/final-investigation-report.ts` - Report generator

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Fix schema drift (image_url column added)
2. ‚úÖ **DONE:** Sync chef recipe counts
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Investigate Nancy Silverton recipe deletion (25 recipes lost)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Investigate Kenji L√≥pez-Alt recipe deletion (11 recipes lost)

### Preventive Measures:
1. **Add migration tracking** - Ensure all schema changes have corresponding migration files
2. **Add recipe count trigger** - Create database trigger to auto-update chef.recipe_count on INSERT/DELETE
3. **Add backup verification** - Check backups before major cleanup commits
4. **Add deletion audit log** - Track when recipes are deleted and by whom

### Data Recovery:
1. Check git history for deleted recipe data
2. Check database backups from before Oct 26
3. Review commit `53e9c39` for any data file deletions
4. Consider re-importing Nancy Silverton and Kenji recipes from source

---

## Root Cause Summary

**Primary Issue:** Schema drift - database missing `image_url` column
**Secondary Issue:** Stale `recipe_count` cache on chef records
**Tertiary Issue:** Potential recipe deletion during cleanup (requires further investigation)

**Impact:** Low - meals intact, schema fixed, counts synced. Recipe deletion needs investigation.

**Resolution Time:** ~30 minutes
