## 🎬 Activity Generation

### Activity Level Distribution

Users are categorized by engagement level:

| Level | Users | Interactions | Description |
|-------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Lurker** | 20% (400) | 0-5 | Browse only, minimal interaction |
| **Occasional** | 40% (800) | 5-15 | Occasional ratings/comments |
| **Regular** | 30% (600) | 20-50 | Active participation |
| **Power** | 10% (200) | 100-250 | Heavy users, multiple activities |

### Activity Types

Activity is distributed realistically across:

- **Ratings** (40%): Rate recipes 1-5 stars
- **Comments** (25%): Leave thoughtful reviews
- **Likes** (15%): Quick appreciation
- **Favorites** (10%): Save recipes
- **Collections** (5%): Organize recipes
- **Meal Plans** (5%): Create weekly meal plans

### Rating Distribution

Ratings follow realistic patterns:

- **5 Stars**: 50% (most popular recipes)
- **4 Stars**: 30% (good recipes)
- **3 Stars**: 15% (decent recipes)
- **2 Stars**: 3% (needs improvement)
- **1 Star**: 2% (rare, poor quality)

### Comment Examples

The system generates varied, authentic comments:

**Enthusiastic**:
- "This recipe is amazing! Made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. My family loved it!"
- "Absolutely delicious! This is going in my regular rotation. Thanks for sharing!"

**With Modifications**:
- "Great recipe! I added a bit of garlic and it was perfect."
- "Made this with a few tweaks - used honey instead of sugar. Turned out great!"

**Constructive**:
- "Good recipe overall. A bit too salty for my taste but I'll adjust next time."
- "Pretty good! I think it could use a bit more seasoning."

**Simple Praise**:
- "Perfect! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
- "So good! Made it twice this week already."

## 🔄 Gradual Phase-Out System

### Philosophy

As real users join the platform, synthetic users should be gradually phased out to maintain authenticity while avoiding sudden drop in activity metrics.

### Deactivation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Deactivate Lurkers (Weeks 1-4)
```bash
# Deactivate 10-20 lurkers per day
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts deactivate 20 lurker
```

#### Phase 2: Deactivate Occasional Users (Weeks 5-12)
```bash
# Deactivate 10-15 occasional users per day
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts deactivate 15 occasional
```

#### Phase 3: Deactivate Regular Users (Weeks 13-24)
```bash
# Deactivate 5-10 regular users per day
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts deactivate 10 regular
```

#### Phase 4: Deactivate Power Users (Weeks 25-52)
```bash
# Deactivate 2-5 power users per week
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts deactivate 5 power
```

### Automated Deactivation (Cron Job)

```bash
# Add to crontab for daily deactivation
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/recipe-manager && pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts deactivate 10
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check current status
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts status
```

Output:
```
📊 SYNTHETIC USER STATISTICS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Total synthetic users:     2000
  └─ Active:               1847

Activity Level Distribution:

## 🗑️ Complete Cleanup

### When to Clean Up

Delete synthetic users when:
- Platform has sufficient real users (500+ active users)
- Real user engagement surpasses synthetic activity
- Preparing for public launch
- Data accuracy is critical (analytics, reporting)

### Cleanup Process

#### Step 1: Deactivate All Synthetic Users
```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts deactivate 2000
```

#### Step 2: Verify Deactivation
```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts status
```

#### Step 3: Delete Deactivated Users (Safe)
```bash
# Only deletes deactivated users
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts delete
```

#### Step 4: Delete All (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# Deletes ALL synthetic users (active + deactivated)
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts delete all
```

### What Gets Deleted

The cleanup script removes:
- ✅ User profiles
- ✅ Recipe ratings
- ✅ Recipe comments
- ✅ Favorites
- ✅ Collections and collection recipes
- ✅ Meals and meal recipes
- ✅ Recipe views

**Note**: Recipe data itself is NOT deleted (in case synthetic users rated real recipes).

## 📊 Database Schema

### Migration: Synthetic User Tracking Fields

```sql
-- Identifies synthetic users
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN is_synthetic_user BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE NOT NULL;

-- Controls visibility (soft delete)
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN synthetic_user_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;

-- Tracks deactivation
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN deactivated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Categorizes engagement level
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN synthetic_activity_level TEXT
  CHECK (synthetic_activity_level IN ('lurker', 'occasional', 'regular', 'power'));

-- Index for efficient filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_user_profiles_synthetic ON user_profiles (is_synthetic_user, synthetic_user_active);
```

### Rollback

```bash
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/00-migration-synthetic-users.ts rollback
```

---

## 🧪 Testing & Verification

### Verify Profile Generation

```bash
# Check generated profiles file
cat scripts/seed-users/generated-profiles.json | jq '. | length'
# Should output: 2000

# Check diversity
cat scripts/seed-users/generated-profiles.json | jq '[.[].location] | group_by(.) | map({location: .[0], count: length}) | sort_by(.count) | reverse | .[0:10]'
```

### Verify Database Insertion

```sql
-- Count synthetic users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles WHERE is_synthetic_user = true;
-- Expected: 2000

-- Check activity level distribution
SELECT synthetic_activity_level, COUNT(*)
FROM user_profiles
WHERE is_synthetic_user = true
GROUP BY synthetic_activity_level;

-- Sample profiles
SELECT username, display_name, location, synthetic_activity_level
FROM user_profiles
WHERE is_synthetic_user = true
LIMIT 10;
```

### Verify Activity Generation

```sql
-- Count ratings by synthetic users
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM recipe_ratings rr
JOIN user_profiles up ON rr.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE up.is_synthetic_user = true;

-- Check rating distribution
SELECT rating, COUNT(*)
FROM recipe_ratings rr
JOIN user_profiles up ON rr.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE up.is_synthetic_user = true
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating DESC;

-- Count comments
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM recipe_comments rc
JOIN user_profiles up ON rc.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE up.is_synthetic_user = true;
```

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### Legal & Ethical

✅ **DO**:
- Use AI-generated faces (no copyright issues)
- Use stock photos with CC0/free licenses
- Clearly mark synthetic users in database
- Have plan to phase out synthetic data

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use photos scraped from social media
- Use photos of real people without permission
- Misrepresent synthetic users as real
- Keep synthetic data indefinitely without disclosure

### Performance

- Profile generation: ~30 seconds
- Database insertion: ~2-3 minutes (batched)
- Activity generation: ~5-10 minutes (depends on recipe count)
- Cleanup: ~1-2 minutes (cascading deletes)

### Data Integrity

- Synthetic users are clearly marked (`is_synthetic_user = true`)
- Can be filtered out of analytics queries
- Gradual deactivation prevents sudden metric drops
- Complete cleanup removes all traces

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Profile generation fails

```bash
# Error: Module not found
# Solution: Ensure running from project root
cd /path/to/recipe-manager
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/01-generate-profiles.ts
```

### Issue: Database insertion fails

```bash
# Error: Duplicate username
# Solution: Drop existing synthetic users and re-run migration
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/99-cleanup-synthetic-users.ts delete all
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/00-migration-synthetic-users.ts rollback
pnpm tsx scripts/seed-users/00-migration-synthetic-users.ts
```

### Issue: Activity generation fails - No recipes found

```bash
# Error: No recipes found!
# Solution: Populate recipes first
# Run your existing recipe seeding scripts
```

### Issue: Avatars not loading

```bash
# Check file exists
ls public/avatars/synthetic/user-001.jpg

# Check permissions
chmod 644 public/avatars/synthetic/*.jpg

# Restart dev server
pnpm dev
```
